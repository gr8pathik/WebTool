//CodeIgniter calls a few built-in hooks as part of its execution process. You can find a complete list of hooks in the user guide. Weâ€™ll use the post_controller_constructor hook which is called immediately after our controller is instantiated and prior to any other method calls.
$hook['post_controller_constructor'] = array(
    'class' => 'LanguageLoader',
    'function' => 'initialize',
    'filename' => 'LanguageLoader.php',
    'filepath' => 'hooks'
);
